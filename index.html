		<div><span class="about-me">I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Ottawa. My interest in programming started with making a small animation in Java console. Of course, then I did not know how to make loops or any programming skills, but something in the painful process of coloring on top of lines and boxes to erase, using Thread.Sleep(100); to animate, and copy pasting hundreds of lines with small changes had attracted me. Then as I evolved and started figuring out solutions by making algorithms made me feel good, and that feeling keeps me coding. Since my first program in Grade 10 to now, I have gained experience through working on different projects using various techonologies such as Android, AngularJS, and Ruby on Rails.
