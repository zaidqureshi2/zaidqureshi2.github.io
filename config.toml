  description = 'I am a Software Engineer and an Entrepreneur. My interest in programming started with making a small animation in Java console. Of course, then I did not know how to make loops or any programming skills, but something in the painful process of coloring on top of lines and boxes to erase, using Thread.Sleep(100); to animate, and copy pasting hundreds of lines with small changes had attracted me. Then as I evolved and started figuring out solutions by making algorithms made me feel good, and that feeling keeps me coding. Since my first program in Grade 10 to now, I have gained experience through leading many projects using various web and mobile technologies.'
